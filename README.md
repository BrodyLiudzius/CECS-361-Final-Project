# CECS 361 Final Project - OISC

This is a Final Project for CECS 361 at CSULB with professor Amin Rezaei. The goal of the assignment is to create an original project using what we have learned about hardware design and Verilog. The project targets the NexysA7-100T development board used in our courses and is developed using Vivado 2016.2.

Our project implements a simple Microcontroller-esque CPU using a One Instruction Set Computer (OISC) architecture.

The lab group consists of:
- Adan Arevalo
- Brody Liudzius
- Ryan Thipavong
