# CECS 361 Final Project - OISC

This is a Final Project for CECS 361 at CSULB with professor Amin Rezaei. This is a group project with the goal of creating an original HDL project using what we have learned about hardware design and Verilog thus far. The project targets the NexysA7-100T development board used in our courses and is developed using Vivado 2023.2. The team consists of Adan Arevalo, Ryan Thipavong, and myself.

Our project implements a simple Microcontroller-esque CPU built around a Harvard-architecture. This machine is a RISC processor with the instruction set simplified down to only a single operation. This is also know as a One Instruction Set Computer (OISC) architecture. The single operation this machine uses is the Move instruction and it is designed as a [Transport-Triggered Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_triggered_architecture).
