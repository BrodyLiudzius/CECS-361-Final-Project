The following tasks *need* to be completed

    - Logical
        - AND
        - OR
        - XOR
        - Logical left shift
        - Logical right shift
    - Arithmetic
        - Divide
- Fix reset logic in `always` blocks (make it dual sensitivity list)
- Rewrite testbenches to be exhaustive and self-checking
- Fix two-state equality checks in testbenches

## Non-vital tasks
These tasks are not required, but would be nice

- Document/Comment all Verilog files
- Add tags to Verilog modules for faster searching in VSCode
- Reformat all files for consistent project code styling. Makes reading code easier
