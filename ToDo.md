## Vital Tasks
The following tasks *need* to be completed

- Merge in testbench branch
- Complete logical and arithmetic function units
    - Divide
- Rewrite testbenches to be exhaustive and self-checking
- Fix two-state equality checks in testbenches
- Make sure all outputs are `reg` or `wire`
- Run all testbenches to make sure they work

## Non-vital tasks
These tasks are not required, but would be nice

- Document/Comment all Verilog files
- Add tags to Verilog modules for faster searching in VSCode
- Reformat all files for consistent project code styling. Makes reading code easier
